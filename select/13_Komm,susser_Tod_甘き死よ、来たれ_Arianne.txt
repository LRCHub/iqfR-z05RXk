I know, i know I've let you down
I've been a fool to myself
I thought that I could
Live for no one else
But now thought all the hurt & pain
It's time for me to respect
The ones you love
Mean more than anything
So with sadness in my heart
Feel the best thing I could do
Is end it all
And leave forever
What's done is done it feels so bad
What once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again
My world is ending

I wish that I could turn back time
'Cos now the guilty is all mine
Can't live without
The trust from those you love
I know we can't forget de past
You can't forget love & pride

Because of that it's kill in me inside

It all returns to nothing, it all comes
Tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing, I just keep
Letting me down, letting me down, letting me down
In my heart of hearts
I know that I called never love again
I've lost everything

Everything
Everything that matters to me, matters in this world

I wish that I could turn back time
'Cos now the guilty is all mine
Can't live without
The trust from those you love

I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love & pride
Because of that it's kill in me inside

It all returns to nothing, it just keeps
Tumbling down, tumbling down,
Tumbling down.
It all returns to nothing, it just keeps
Letting me down, letting me down,
Letting me down.

It all returns to nothing, it just keeps
Tumbling down, tumbling down,
Tumbling down.
It all returns to nothing, it just keeps
Letting me down, letting me down,
Letting me down.
