<♪>
I know. I know I've let you down
I've been fool to myself
I thought that I could
Live for no one else
But now through all
the hurt & pain
It's time for me to respect
The ones you love
Mean more than anything
So with sadness in my heart
(I) feel the best thing
I could do is end it all
and leave forever
what's done is done it feels
so bad
what once was happy now is sad
I'll never love again
My world is ending
I wish that I could
turn back time
Cos now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without
The trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love & pride
Because of that. It's kill
in me inside
<♪>
It all returns to nothing.
it all comes tumbling down,
tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing.
I just keep letting me down,
letting me down, letting me down
In my heart of hearts
I know that I called never love
again
I've lost everything
Everything
Everything that matters to me.
matters in this world
I wish that l could
turn back time
Cos now the guilt is all mine
Can't live without
The trust from those you love
I know we can't forget the past
You can't forget love & pride
Because of that, It's kill
in me inside
<♪>
It all returns to nothing.
it just keeps tumbling down,
tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing.
I just keep letting me down,
letting me down, letting me down
It all returns to nothing.
it just keeps tumbling down,
tumbling down, tumbling down
It all returns to nothing.
I just keep letting me
letting me down, letting me down
